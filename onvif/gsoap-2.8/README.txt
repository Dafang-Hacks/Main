Thanks for using gSOAP!

The gSOAP toolkit provides a cross-platform software development toolkit for C
and C++ server and client Web service applications, and simplifies the overall
use of XML in any type of application. The toolkit supports SOAP 1.1/1.2 RPC
encoding and document/literal styles, WSDL 1.1, MTOM/MIME/DIME attachments
(streaming), SOAP-over-UDP, request-response and one-way messaging. The toolkit
also supports WS-Addressing and WS-Security, with several other WS-* available
or under development. See the official open-source gSOAP website
http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net for project status and latest news.

* The gSOAP 'soapcpp2' compiler and code generator and 'stdsoap2' runtime
  engine are stable since version release 2.1.3.

* The gSOAP 'wsdl2h' WSDL/schema parser and code generator is stable since
  wsdl2h version release 1.1.0. The 'wsdl2h' tool fully supports WSDL 1.1,
  XML schemas, WS-Policy, and other WS-* protocols (details in the fact sheet).

The software is provided "as is", without any warranty. However, gSOAP
has been extensively field-tested in production-quality software development.
We continue to improve gSOAP and add new features.

WHAT'S COOL?
================================================================================

The gSOAP 'wsdl2h' tool is a gSOAP application itself, which demonstrates the
capabilities of the generic XML handling by the toolkit to parse WSDL, XML
schemas, and SOAP/XML.

The gSOAP toolkit supports streaming technologies to expedite SOAP/XML and
MTOM/MIME attachment transfers of potentially unlimited data lengths.

The gSOAP toolkit is the only toolkit that supports the serialization of native
C and C++ data types directly in XML. You can use it to export and import your
application data in XML without having to write wrapper routines.

The gSOAP toolkit ensures as small memory footprint. XML is a processed as a
transient format and not buffered. Many optimizations have been applied to
reduce resource requirements and to expedite XML parsing.

The gSOAP toolkit provides stand-alone HTTP(S) web server functionality as well
as Apache mod and IIS hooks (located in gsoap/mod_gsoap). Also CGI and FastCGI
are supported. A web server example demonstrating the stand-alone functionality
is included in the package.

PACKAGE
================================================================================

This distribution package contains platform-independent source code. Pre-built
'soapcpp2' and 'wsdl2h' binaries are included for the following platforms:

	* Win32 i386 compatible
	* Linux i386 compatible
	* MAC OS X universal

The binaries are located in 'gsoap/bin'.

Important: these 'wsdl2h' binaries use the default configuration without SSL
support (no HTTPS site access).

To configure and build the toolkit binaries and libraries, please see the
installation instructions in the 'INSTALLATION' section below.

================================================================================
GETTING STARTED
================================================================================

Follow the installation instructions in INSTALL.txt first.

The gSOAP 'wsdl2h' tool converts WSDLs into a gSOAP header file for processing
with the gSOAP stub/skeleton generator 'soapcpp2' to generate XML
serialization, stubs, and skeletons code to build Web services applications.
Use 'wsdl2h' followed by 'soapcpp2' to translate an entire set of WSDL and XML
schemas into representative C or C++ data structures and associated XML
parsers. You can also use the gSOAP 'soapcpp2' tool directly on existing C/C++
data structure declarations to create XML serialization routines for these
types to simplify the storage of data in XML.

Example translation of WSDL to code in two steps:

	$ wsdl2h -s -o calc.h http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/calc.wsdl
	$ soapcpp2 calc.h

The 'calc.h' header file contains the services and XML schema types represented
in C/C++, together with other useful information copied from the WSDL related
to the service. Run Doxygen on it to generate a nice set of pages.

Do not include the wsdl2h-generated 'calc.h' header file directly into your
code (the declarations are replicated in the generated code). The header file
is processed by the gSOAP stub compiler 'soapcpp2' to generate the following
files for your project:

	soapClient.cpp	client-side stub routines for service invocation
	soapServer.cpp	server-side skeleton routines for server development
	soapC.cpp	C/C++ parameter marshalling code
	calc.nsmap	An XML-to-C/C++ namespare mapping table

To compile a client, all you need to do is to compile and link 'soapC.cpp',
'soapClient.cpp', and 'stdsoap2.cpp' (or the installed libgsoap++, see
INSTALLATION) with your code. To access the service in your code:

	#include "soapH.h"
	#include "calc.nsmap"
        main()
	{ struct soap *soap = soap_new(); // alloc 'soap' engine context
	  double result;
	  if (soap_call_ns2__add(soap, NULL, NULL, 1.0, 2.0, result) == SOAP_OK)
	    std::cout << "The sum of 1.0 and 2.0 is " << result << std::endl;
	  else
	    soap_stream_fault(soap, std::cerr);
	  soap_destroy(soap); // dealloc serialization data
	  soap_end(soap);     // dealloc temp data
	  soap_free(soap);    // dealloc 'soap' engine context
	}

First, this imports all soapcpp-generated definitions and the namespace mapping
table. Then the soap_call_ns2__add() invokes the service. This function is
generated from the calc.h file by soapcpp2. The calc.h file includes
instructions on what functions to call.

To develop a C++ client application based on C++ proxy objects rather than
C-like functions, use 'soapcpp2' option -i:

	$ wsdl2h -s -o calc.h http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/calc.wsdl
	$ soapcpp2 -i calc.h

This generates 'soapcalcProxy.h' and 'soapcalcProxy.cpp' with a calcProxy
class with service methods that you can use to invoke services. For example:

	#include "soapcalcProxy.h"
	#include "calc.nsmap"
	main()
	{ calcProxy service;
	  double result;
	  if (service.add(1.0, 2.0, result) == SOAP_OK)
	    std::cout << "The sum of 1.0 and 2.0 is " << result << std::endl;
  	  else
	    service.soap_stream_fault(std::cerr);
	  service.destroy(); // dealloc serialization and temp data
	}

Compile the above program and link with 'soapC.cpp', 'soapcalcProxy.cpp', and
'stdsoap2.cpp' (or -lgsoap++).

To develop a C client, use 'wsdl2h' option -c to generate pure C code.

There are many options that you can use depending on the need to develop C
applications, C++ with or without STL, or C++ proxy and server objects. In
addition, the XML schema type mapping is defined by 'typemap.dat', located in
the project root and 'WS' folders. The 'typemap.dat' file is used to customize
the 'wsdl2h' output. It is important to use this file for larger projects that
depend in WS-* protocols, such as WS-Addressing and WS-Security.

More information about the 'wsdl2h' and 'soapcpp2' tools and their options can
be found in the gSOAP documentation and the Quick How-To page on the gSOAP Web
site, see: http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net

See also the 'gsoap/wsdl/README.txt' for more details on the WSDL parser and
installation. The 'gsoap/bin' folder includes pre-built 'soapcpp2' and
'wsdlh2' executables for various platforms.

================================================================================
EXTERNAL THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES
================================================================================

The gSOAP toolkit is mostly self-contained and does not require any third-party
software to run in a basic configuration. When compression and SSL encryption
are required the Zlib and OpenSSL libraries must be installed.

To build the gSOAP 'soapcpp2' compiler, you must have Bison and Flex installed
or the older Yacc and Lex equivalents. Note that licensing differs for Flex
versus Lex, and Bison versus Yacc.

Win32 builds of clients and services requires winsock.dll. To do this in
Visual C++ 6.0, go to "Project", "settings", select the "Link" tab (the
project file needs to be selected in the file view) and add "wsock32.lib" to
the "Object/library modules" entry. The distribution contains a Visual Studio
2005 project example in the 'samples/calc_vs2005' folder with the necessary
project settings to link libraries and automatically invoke to soapcpp2
compiler as a custom build.

================================================================================
DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

WE TRY OUR BEST TO PROVIDE YOU WITH "REAL-WORLD" EXAMPLES BUT WE CANNOT
GUARANTEE THAT ALL CLIENT EXAMPLES CAN CONNECT TO THIRD PARTY WEB SERVICES
WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE DOWN OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
