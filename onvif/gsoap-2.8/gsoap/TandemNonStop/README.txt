The Tandem NonStop bridge enables the gSOAP toolkit for Tandem NonStop
platforms. The bridge replaces the IO operation of the gSOAP engine with Tandem
NonStop IO operations.

The approach requires the code to be generated on any platform with the wsdl2h
and soapcpp2 tools. The generated code can be compiled an run on Tandem using
the bridge with the gSOAP engine (implemented in stdsoap2.c/.cpp). The wsdl2h
and soapcpp2 tools will not run on Tandem, which would not be necessary.

When your environment supports OSS sockets then this bridge is not required.

Tandem NonStop bridge for gSOAP 2.8.0 and higher to support Guardian sockets:

  tandem.h	Tandem IO bridge interface
  tandem.c	Tandem blocking IO bridge
  tandemnw.c	Tandem nonblocking IO (no wait) bridge

Usage:

  Add to your client/server code the following:

  #include "tandem.h"
  struct soap *soap = soap_new();
  tandem_init(soap, "ProcName");
  socket_set_inet_name(argv[0]); // See Tandem docs
  ... // client or server code goes here as per gSOAP documentation
  soap_destroy(soap);
  soap_end(soap);
  tandem_done(soap);
  soap_free(soap);

Compile flags for compiling the gSOAP software:

  -DTANDEM_NONSTOP

Linkage requirements:

  Compile and link with tandem.c or tandemnw.c, and stdsoap2.c

Use soapcpp2 option -p to generate shorter file names, for example:

  soapcpp2 -c -L -pT calc.h

generates

TStub.h
TH.h
TC.c
TClient.c
TServer.c

To compile the examples:

  cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o client client.c TC.c TClient.c stdsoap2.c tandem.c
    or
  cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o client client.c TC.c TClient.c stdsoap2.c tandemnw.c

  cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o server server.c TC.c TServer.c stdsoap2.c tandem.c
    or
  cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o server server.c TC.c TServer.c stdsoap2.c tandemnw.c

where 'cc' refers to your C compiler.
