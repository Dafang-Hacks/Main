  Tandem NonStop bridge for gSOAP 2.8.0 and higher:

    tandem.h	Tandem IO
    tandem.c	Tandem blocking IO

  Usage:

    Add to your client/server code the following set up:

    #include "tandem.h"
    struct soap *soap = soap_new();
    tandem_init(soap, "ProcName");
    socket_set_inet_name(argv[0]); // See Tandem docs
    ... // client or server code goes here as per gSOAP documentation
    soap_destroy(soap);
    soap_end(soap);
    tandem_done(soap);
    soap_free(soap);

  Compile flags for C/C++:

    -DTANDEM_NONSTOP

  Linkage requirements:

    Compile and link with tandem.c or tandem_nw.c

  Example:

    cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o calcclient calcclient.c soapC.c soapClient.c stdsoap2.c tandem.c
      or
    cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o calcclient calcclient.c soapC.c soapClient.c stdsoap2.c tandem_nw.c

    cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o calcserver calcserver.c soapC.c soapServer.c stdsoap2.c tandem.c
      or
    cc -DTANDEM_NONSTOP -o calcserver calcserver.c soapC.c soapServer.c stdsoap2.c tandem_nw.c
