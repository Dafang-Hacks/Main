<h1 align="center"><font face="Verdana">mod_gsoap ISAPI Extension</font></h1>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html">gsoap</a>
is an open source project that can be used to generate </font><font face="Verdana"> <b>S</b>imple <b>O</b>bject <b>A</b>ccess <b>P</b>rotocol
(<a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/SOAP">SOAP</a>) clients and servers. <a href="http://www.aberger.at/SOAP"> mod_gsoap</a>
allows you to run these services integrated in process inside the Microsoft Internet
Information server.&nbsp;It is implemented as an ISAPI extension dll and so can
be run together with all other services on IIS.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Overview</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">There is an open source project at <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html">http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html</a>
 which implements SOAP in C++. Servers created there can be run standalone or as
cgi. This is a contribution to get a production quality Web service for MS-Internet Information
Server that drives SOAP servers. All the source code and
documentation is available for download.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Existing gsoap servers can be compiled <u>without
any change</u> in the source code to run inside IIS. There is one dll, mod_gsoap.dll, an Isapi extension that serves SOAP
requests. From the query string in the request the extension finds out which server should be used
and the appropriate server dll (dynamic link library) is dynamically loaded at
runtime, if not already present. This SOAP server creates the response which is
sent back to the client by IIS.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">To add more servers only the new dlls need
to be compiled, the ISAPI interface need not be changed for that, the Web
Service not even restarted.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">This distribution contains also the
standard gsoap calc.h - server to demonstrate operation.&nbsp;The source code of
that example was not changed from the standard distribution.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Once your gsoap service works as a
standalone application, you only need to recompile it as a dll and copy that dll
to your IIS - virtual directory.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"> In spite of that instructions can be found
<a href="#iisdebug"> below</a> for debugging the IIS extension under Windows™ 2000 and XP.&nbsp;</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Requirements&nbsp;</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">To build the mod_gsoap ISAPI extension for Windows you need the following:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">gsoap 2.3.8 or higher from </font>
    <font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html" target="_blank">gsoap</a>
 </font>
  <li><font face="Verdana">mod_gsoap_win_0_0_2.zip from <a href="http://www.aberger.at/SOAP/mod_gsoap_win_0_0_2.zip">http://www.aberger.at/SOAP/mod_gsoap_win_0_0_2.zip</a></font>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">To run mod_gsoap ISAPI extension you need either Windows™ NT
4.0 with Windows™ NT Option Pack 4.0, Windows™ 2000 or Windows XP or higher, where IIS™ is
integrated.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Installation and testing&nbsp;</font></h2>
<h3><font face="Verdana">Unpack and/or compile the mod_gsoap.dll ISAPI extension</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Unpack the mod_gsoap_win_*.zip package.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Make sure that gsoap 2.1.8 or higher is unpacked on
    your computer.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">The package already contains the compiled
    mod_gsoap.dll, so if you don't want to compile it yourself you can skip the next few
    lines and continue with <a href="#iisinstall">installation</a>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Open Visual Studio C++ 6.0</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Go to &quot;Tools|Options&quot;. Activate the
    &quot;Directories&quot; Panel.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Select&nbsp; &quot;Include Files&quot; from the
    dropdown and add your soapcpp directory (the one where you have unoacked
    soap 2.18 or higher). This will let the compiler find stdsoap2.H</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Select &quot;Executable Path&quot; and add the same
    directory also there. This will let Visual Studio find soapcpp2.exe</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Open all4iis.dsw</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Activate the &quot;all4iis&quot; project and build
    all.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="iisinstall"><font face="Verdana">Installation of mod_gsoap.dll ISAPI extension
on your IIS Server</font></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Add a gsoap folder to your wwwroot directory (e.g.
    C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\gsoap)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Open Internet Service Manager from Control
    Panel-&gt;Administrative tools.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Create in Internet Service Manager a new virtual
    directory called &quot;gsoap&quot; (details <a href="#vroot">here</a> and
    also on the <a href="images/gsoapvdir.png">Screen Snapshot</a>).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Copy mod_gsoap.dll and calc.dll to the created gsoap
    folder (C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\gsoap)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Start the &quot;World Wide Web Publishing
    Service&quot;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Enter in your browser &quot;<a href="http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll">http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll</a>&quot;.
    This should give a response from the server that explains what the correct url is. If so this proves that mod_gsoap.dll is configured correctly.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Next enter in your browser &quot;<a href="http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?calc">http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?calc</a>&quot;.
    This should give a response from the server that you should use a POST
    command, not a GET. This proves that mod_gsoap could load your server dll. So in principle your installation seems to be OK now.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Check the file .\isapi\samples\calc\calcclnt.c
    The URL there must corrspond to your installation. Check the line:<br>
    </font><font face="Courier">const char server[] = &quot;<font color="#FF0000">http://localhost//gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?calc</font>&quot;;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Open a DOS - command window and change to the
    directory where calcclnt.exe has been build within the all4iis project.
    Enter &quot;calcclnt add 3 5&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Check that the response is:
    &quot;result=8&quot;. If so: Done!&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">If not so please read the <a href="#FAQ">FAQ</a>.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a dime sample in the code that shows you how to send and receive dime attachments (binary files etc). 
This sample also shows how to use module initializer and terminators. When the dll is loaded into IIS for the first time the function mod_gsoap_init is called. 
Here you can initialize database connections or whatever you like. mod_gsoap_terminate is called when the dll is unloaded again. A good place to clean up.</p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Compiling your own gsoap - Servers for use with
mod_gsoap</font></h2>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Build and test your standalone gsoap server as
    documented in </font><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html">gsoap</a>.&nbsp; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Make sure that your Visual Studio include and
    executable paths is correct as described above.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">In Visual Studio C++ 6.0 select &quot;File|New&quot;.
    Create a new empty Win32 - Dynamic Link Library.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Copy <a name="stdsoap2.def"> stdsoap2.def</a> from the .\isapi\samples\calc example to your
    project directory and add it to the project. This will ensure that the
    required functions (soap_initialize, soap_serve, soap_end, soap_free, etc) are exported from the dll.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Compile it</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Copy it to the ...wwwroot/gsoap directory described
    above.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Done!</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">The <a href="#urlconstruction">URL</a> for the new
servers is always &quot;<a href="http://localhost//gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?mydll"></a></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier"><a href="http://localhost//gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?mydll">http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?mydll</a>&quot;
</font><font face="Verdana">where mydll is the name of our dll <u>without</u>
the .dll extension.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Verdana"><a name="vroot">Details for creating the virtual root</a></font></h4>
<p><font face="Verdana">If you have problems creating the virtual root as
descibed above here a short how-to: Open from control panel &quot;Administrative Tools&quot;
and then &quot;Internet Services Manager&quot; (under Windows™ NT 4.0 you find it
in the Option Pack submenus). Click with the right mouse button on &quot;Default
Web Site&quot;, then select &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Virtual Directory&quot;.
Click &quot;Next&quot; and enter as Alias the name you want to give to the url,
e.g. &quot;soap&quot;, press &quot;Next&quot; again. Then browse for the
directory where your dll that you have built in the previous step is, for
example &quot;c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\gsoap&quot;. Press
&quot;Next&quot;, then in the access permissions, disable all permissions except
&quot;Excute (such as ISAPI applications or CGI)&quot;, this must be enabled.
Click &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Finish&quot;. For testing it might be a good
idea to enable the &quot;Browse&quot; permission and then browse to
&quot;http://localhost/gsoap&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="urlconstruction">How the url of the request is constructed</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">The ISAPI SOAP Binding can run together with all other
Internet services on your machine on port 80 (or any other, as configured in
IIS). It is an extension for IIS. The request your SOAP client must submit is
made up of 2 parts. Here is an example:</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New"> &quot;http://127.0.0.1/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?mySoap&quot;</font><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The part before the question mark '?' is the url for the
isapi binding dll. This is evaluated by IIS. In this sample the service is on
the same machine as the server. Instead of &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; you can use the
DNS address of your server, of course. gsoap is the virtual root created above
and mod_gsoap.dll is the generic ISAPI binding from this contribution. The
extension mod_gsoap.dll evaluates the part behind the '?', which is in this example
mySoap. To this the string &quot;.dll&quot; is appended and the dll is loaded. Due
to security reasons only dlls from the same directory are allowed. If you want to do special
initialization in your dll you may want to add and export a &quot;DllMain&quot;
function, which will be called when the IIS process attaches to your all and
before it detaches it. Do not rely on the Thread attach/detach callback, in my
experience IIS does not always call DllMain in your dll if these threads were
already in the thread pool before your dll was loaded. Use thread local storage
instead.</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<H2><a name="iisdebug">Development and Debugging</a></H2>
<p>There are a lot to say about debugging of course. Please make sure that your
gsoap server works as a standalone server and client before you continue to use
it inside IIS.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IIS Debugging</h3>
<P> For Debugging with Win2000 I added two .reg files, that switch 
debugging of IIS on and off (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q273639" target="_blank">Q273639</a>
and related), and a start and stop command in the 
Makefile to start and stop iis debugging. Make sure that the path to msdev is in the System environment
variables (&quot;PATH&quot;) of the system account (not only of your own user
account, this is not seen by IISAdmin).&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you want to debug, you must set the dll to run 
in-proccess. Right-click on the gsoap virtual root in internet service manager 
and set the &quot;Appication Protection&quot; to &quot;Low (IIS Process)&quot;. 
Remove the &quot;Enable Session State&quot; and buffering and Parent 
Paths. Don't forget to allow the IISAdmin and WWW Service to interact with desktop. </P>        
</font>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Makefile</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">I added some commands to a Windoze &quot;Makefile&quot;.
To make live easier. See the Makefile yourself, there are&nbsp; commands to start and
stop debugging of IIS and cleaning the directory. The very advanced Windoze user can even compile
everything without a mouse by running one command. Be sure that msdev.exe and nmake.exe are in your PATH.
Then enter from the commandline:&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier">nmake</font><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Such advanced users should also consider to use the
linux/unix version mod_gsoap.so, also available on <a href="http://mx.aberger.at/SOAP/apache_index.html"> this
site</a>. ;-)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Enjoy!</font></p>

<h1><a name="FAQ">Frequently asked questions</a></h1>
<ol>
  <li>Q: mod_gsoap answers properly in the browser. But then I get the following
    output:</li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Courier New">C:\&gt;calcclnt.exe add 3 5<br>
SOAP FAULT: SOAP-ENV:Client<br>
&quot;End of file or no input&quot;<br>
Detail: <a href="http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?calc">http://localhost/gsoap/mod_gsoap.dll?calc</a><br>
<br>
</font>Answer:&nbsp;<br>
Step one: Could you please compile calcclnt.exe with the DEBUG option.<br>
(in Preprocessor Definitions add DEBUG).<br>
Delete all .log files from the current directory if any. Then run<br>
again calcclnt.exe add 3 5<br>
<br>
Then you should get 3 files with the extension &quot;.log&quot; in the current<br>
directory. Please read what is in there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step two: Make sure that dumpbin.exe is in your PATH (it can be found
somewhere in Visual Studio 6.0 binaries).<br>
Open a command shell, change&nbsp; to the directory where mod_gsoap.dll is
located (C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\gsoap) and type the following:<br>
dumpbin /exports calc.dll. This output should contain the exported symbols that are listed
in the stdsoap2.def file. If you don't find these symbols you propably forgot to add the stdsoap2.def file
described <a href="#stdsoap2.def">here</a>.</p>
