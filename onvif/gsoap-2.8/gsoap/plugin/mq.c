/**

@page mq_0 The mq plugin for inbound message queueing and message replay

The inbound message queueing plugin can be used to queue messages that should
not be discarded with the WS-RM protocol's NoDiscard behavior. Messages that
are out of sequence as per WS-RM protocol and should be handled by one thread
(or a thread pool) should be queued for later replay and service operation
invocation. If an unlimited number of threads is available, the simplest WS-RM
protocol NoDiscard behavior is implemented by starting a thread for each
inbound message and letting the thread block with the
soap_wsrm_check_and_wait() or soap_wsrm_check_send_empty_response_and_wait()
calls. However, that approach is not efficient with HTTP keep-alive because the
next messages on the keep-alive socket will be blocked from being processes.
This plugin is designed to process messages on an HTTP keep-alive socket even
when operations block.

@section mq_1 Server-Side Queueing of One-Way Messages

Queueing one-way messages for internal replay is implemented with the message
queueing plugin as follows, by queueing inbound messages received on a single
socket and then replaying them all in sequence as received from the socket:

@code
#include "mq.h"

  struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE);
  soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_mq);
  ...
  // port bind etc
  ...
  while (soap_valid_socket(soap_accept(soap)))
  {
    // queue all messages on this socket (socket is HTTP keep alive)
    // for each message received, we send HTTP 202 Accepted
    struct ms_queue *queue = soap_mq_queue(soap);
    struct ms_msg *msg;
    while (soap_mq_get(soap, queue))
      soap_send_empty_response(soap, 202); // 202 Accept

    // we now internally replay all messages to invoke services
    // services are assumed to NOT send a response message back
    // i.e. one-way operations
    for (msg = soap_mq_begin(queue); msg; msg = soap_mq_next(msg))
      soap_serve(&msg->soap);

    // delete all queued messages, also calls these on each queued msg state:
    // soap_destroy(&msg->soap);
    // soap_end(&msg->soap);
    // soap_done(&msg->soap);
    soap_mq_del(queue, NULL);

    // delete the queue (allocated in current context)
    soap_destroy(soap);
    soap_end(soap);
  }
@endcode

Alternatively, it is also possible to call soap_mq_del(queue, msg) after
soap_serve(&msg->soap) to immediately delete the message after processing
(calling soap_mq_next(msg) next in the loop is still valid).

@section mq_2 WS-RM Server-Side Message Queueing for NoDiscard Behavior with Callback Services

When messages are controlled by the WS-ReliableMessaging protocol, we can keep
the WS-RM messages in a queue that were received out of order until the order
is restored and queued messages can be dispatched. This WS-RM behavior is
desirable with WS-RM NoDiscard. To implement this approach, we use an inbound
message queue for each socket accepted and processed by a thread.

@code
#include "wsaapi.h"
#include "wsrmapi.h"
#include "mq.h"
#include "threads.h"

  struct soap *soap = soap_new1(SOAP_IO_KEEPALIVE);
  soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsa);
  soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_wsrm);
  soap_register_plugin(soap, soap_mq);
  ...
  // port bind etc
  ...
  while (soap_valid_socket(soap_accept(soap)))
  {
    THREAD_TYPE tid;
    struct soap *tsoap = soap_copy(soap);
    if (!tsoap)
    { soap_closesock(soap);
      continue;
    }
    THREAD_CREATE(&tid, (void*(*)(void*))process_request, (void*)tsoap);
  }

void *process_request(void *tsoap)
{
  struct soap *soap = (struct soap*)tsoap;
  struct ms_queue *queue = soap_mq_queue(soap);
  struct ms_msg *msg;
  struct soap ctx;
  while ((msg = soap_mq_get(soap, queue)) != NULL)
  {
    // parse the message headers, if NoDiscard then keep message in queue to retry later
    // copy the context, since we want to preserve the original to retry later
    soap_copy_context(&ctx, &msg->soap);

    if (soap_begin_serve(&ctx))
    {
      soap_send_fault(&ctx); // send fault, close socket
      soap_mq_del(queue, msg); // delete message from queue
    }
    else if (!ctx.header || !ctx.header->wsrm__Sequence)
    {
      // this is not a WS-RM message, so serve immediately
      soap_serve(&msg->soap); // service operations
      soap_mq_del(queue, msg); // delete message from queue
    }
    else if (!soap_wsrm_check(&ctx))
    {
      // check is OK, process this WS-RM message now
      soap_serve(&msg->soap); // service operations SHOULD NOT call soap_wsrm_check()
      soap_mq_del(queue, msg); // delete message from queue
    }
    else if (ctx.error != SOAP_STOP)
    {
      // check failed, not a WS-RM message or other WS-RM error
      soap_send_fault(&ctx); // send fault, close socket
      soap_mq_del(queue, msg); // delete message from queue
    }
    soap_destroy(&ctx);
    soap_end(&ctx);
    soap_done(&ctx);
  }
  // as long as the queue is not empty and WS-RM sequence(s) not terminated, keep trying
  while ((msg = soap_mq_begin(queue)) != NULL)
  {
    // process queued WS-RM messages
    for (; msg != NULL; msg = soap_mq_next(msg))
    {
      // try next message in queue
      soap_copy_context(&ctx, &msg->soap);
      if (!soap_begin_serve(&ctx) && !soap_wsrm_check(&ctx))
      {
        // check is OK, process message
        soap_serve(&msg->soap);
        soap_mq_del(queue, msg);
      }
      else if (ctx.error != SOAP_STOP)
        soap_mq_del(queue, msg);
      soap_destroy(&ctx);
      soap_end(&ctx);
      soap_done(&ctx);
    }
    sleep(1); // sleep some before around we go again
  }
  return NULL;
}
@endcode

In the first loop that runs over the messages received on the same keep-alive
socket, the messages will be processed and services dispatched immediately for
non-WS-RM messages and when the WS-RM check succeeds. This check is done in
the server dispatch loop as shown, which means that WS-RM-based service
operations SHOULD NOT call soap_wsrm_check() again. WS-RM messages that cannot
be processed yet since they are out of the sequence order will remain in the
queue.

The second loop over the queued messages will retry to dispatch service
operations according to the WS-RM message order as required by WS-RM NoDiscard
sequence behavior. The loop will run until the queue is empty or when the WS-RM
sequences are closed/terminated.
