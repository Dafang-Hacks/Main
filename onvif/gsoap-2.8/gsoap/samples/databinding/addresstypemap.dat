#	Example typemap.dat file for the address book example

#	Bind the address book schema namespace to prefix 'a'

a = "urn:address-book-example"

#	By default the xsd:dateTime schema type is translated to time_t
#	To map xsd:dateTime to struct tm, enable the following line:

# xsd__dateTime = #import "../../custom/struct_tm.h" | xsd__dateTime

#	... and compile/link with custom/struct_tm.c
