	This example application demonstrates server-side and client-side logic
	for services based on WS-Addressing. At the server side, WS-Addressing
	enables forwarding/relaying of service responses and faults to other
	services. At the client side, a relayed response or fault will not be
	received and an HTTP ACCEPTED (code 202) is delivered instead, assuming
	that the relay was successful.

	This header file illustrates two gSOAP soapcpp2 tooling tricks to
	enable services to accept SOAP Fault messages and to create a one-way
	service operation to handle responses.

	Compile with (note the use of soapcpp2 -a to handle http action header):

	soapcpp2 -a -c -Iimport wsademo.h
	cc -Iplugin -o wsademo wsademo.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapClient.c soapServer.c plugin/wsaapi.c

	Usage:

	After compilation, start the main server at port 11001:
	> ./wsademo 11001

	In a new window, start a return service at port 11002:
	> ./wsademo 11002
	This service handles response messages from the main service.

	In a new window, start a fault service at port 11003:
	> ./wsademo 11003
	This service handles faults from the main service.

	In a new window, run the client:
	> ./wsademo hello
	This example shows the server returning "hello" to the client.

	> ./wsademo fault
	This example shows the server returning a SOAP fault to the client:
	"The demo service wsademo() operation returned a fault".

	> ./wsademo hello r
	This example shows the server returning "hello" to the return service.

	> ./wsademo hello n
	This example shows the server accepting the message without reply.

	> ./wsademo error e
	This example shows the server returning a wsa fault to fault service:
	"The endpoint is unable to process the message at this time".

	> ./wsademo fault e
	This example shows the server returning a SOAP fault to fault service.
	"The demo service wsademo() operation returned a fault".

	Note: when the response service is down, the response cannot be relayed
	and the client (or fault service) will be informed about the failure.

/* To generate SOAP-ENV:Fault struct via a one-way service operation.
