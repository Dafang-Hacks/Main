The gSOAP 'soapcpp2' source-to-source code compiler

INSTRUCTIONS

The gSOAP soapcpp2 tool translates annotated C/C++ header files with interface
defitions for services and clients to service and client implementation code.
It also maps the C/C++ types to XML types, with the ability to generate XML
schema and WSDL documents.

When starting from WSDL and/or XML schemas, first use the gSOAP 'wsdl2h' tool
to translate these into C/C++ header file with interface definitions. Then use
'soapcpp2' to translate these into implementation code.

See also the README.txt in the 'wsdl' directory and documentation on the use of
'wsdl2h' with 'soapcpp2'.

CONTENTS

This part of the distribution contains the following files:

README.txt	This file
MakefileManual	Extra makefile when autoconf/automake fail to produce one
soapcpp2.h	Main header file
soapcpp2.c	Main application
symbol2.c	Symbol table handling and code generation module
error2.h	Header file for error2.c
error2.c	Error handling routines
init2.c		Compiler symbol table initialization
soapcpp2_lex.l	Flex/Lex tokens
soapcpp2_yacc.y	Yacc/Bison grammar

INSTALLATION

Use './configure' and 'make' in the root directory, as explained in the
installation instructions.

To build 'soapcpp2' when autoconf/automake fail, use:

	make -f MakefileManual

The above command assumes you have Bison and Flex installed. For Yacc, please
edit MakefileManual and change as follows:

YACC=yacc -d -v -s soapcpp2_yacc
CMFLAGS=-DWITH_YACC -DWITH_FLEX

QNX INSTALLATION

On QNX the bison.simple file is located in $QNX_HOST/usr/share/bison.simple
Update your .profile to include:

export BISON_SIMPLE=$QNX_HOST/usr/share/bison/bison.simple 
export BISON_HAIRY=$QNX_HOST/usr/share/bison/bison.hairy 

WIN32 INSTALLATION

You need to install Flex and Bison to build soapcpp2.

An MSN article explains how to do this with MS VS2005:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730877(VS.80).aspx#vccustombr_topic3

The older Bison v1.6 can crash on Win32 systems if YYINITDEPTH is too small:
Compile with /DYYINITDEPTH=5000
