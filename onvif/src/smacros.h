 * For GCC 4.6 or higher, in C++ you can use a standard right static_assert(exp, msg) in *.c and in *.h files.
 * For GCC 4.6 is required to add CFLAGS += -std="c++0x"
 * Simple C (gcc) have static_assert in std=c11.
 * A lot of variants, it is the most simple and intuitive
 * It can be used in *.c and in *.h files. (macros that use function style can be used in *.c files only)
 *
 * Disadvantages: you can not be set msg to display the console when compiling
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * STATIC_ASSERT( sizeof(char) == 1)  //good job
 * STATIC_ASSERT( sizeof(char) != 1)  //You will get a compilation error
